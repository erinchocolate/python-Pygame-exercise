# Diagram editor & Tic Tac Toe

In diagram editor, users can:

- drag and draw rectangle, circle, and line shape
- choose color during the drawing process
- move shape
- resize shapes
- add a label to shapes
- change shapes’ color
- save shape data into a txt file
- load and display shape data from a txt file

There are two sample txt.file(flowchart.txt and mindmap.txt) in the project that you can load into the program.



### Tic tac toe

In this game,

- users can click the game board to place the move
- the computer generates a random move
- display winner or tie after the game finishes



### **Continued development**

- Save label and label color data when saving a file
- Read and display label when loading a file
- In the current Tic Tac Toe game, it’s always the player to move first. Needs to rotate who starts first each turn.
- In the current Tic Tac Toe game, the computer generates random moves. Can implement Minimax algorithm to make computer play “smarter”.
