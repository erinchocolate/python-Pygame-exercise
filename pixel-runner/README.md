## My process

### Built with

- Python 3.10
- Python random module
- Pygame

### What I learned

I use [sprite](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html) class to create player and obstacles, which makes it easy to control the movement and animation of game sprites.

The benefits of using sprite class:

- combines a surface and a rect
- can contain more(sounds, animations, behaviour etc)
- can target multiple sprites via groups

How to make animation:

```python
self.animation_index = 0
self.image = self.frames[self.animation_index]

def animation(self):
	self.animation_index += 0.1
	if self.animation_index >= len(self.frames):
		self.animation_index = 0
		self.image = self.frames[int(self.animation_index)]
```
